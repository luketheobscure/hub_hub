    Artists' Reception: Dick Haas and Madhu John

Dick Haas "Out to Lunch"  July  5 - 29
 These are images captured as transparencies and, more
recently, digitally.All are photographs taken on the street of people engaged
in reading books or newspapers. Most were taken  while
my wife and I were abroad in various professional capacities.
 The oldest are some 25 years old, the most
recent about 2 years ago. They are from Asia, Eastern
Europe and Russia, China, India, the US and Latin
America. None of the subjects were aware that I had taken
their photograph. Great Art they are not, but my hope is
that viewers will find the people in context of some visual
interest.

Showing with Dack Haas is:

Madhu John - "How to be Alone"
BIO:   I spent my childhood, youth and young adulthood
in the megalopolises of Mumbai and New York.  My first
exposure to photography was through my father, a journalist
and later an environmentalist.  I remember his rolleiflex which
he used extensively on the family and then landmarks and buildings
and eventually on trees and other vegetation.
I suspect it was living in New York city that initiated my
enthusiasm for photography.  everywhere you turned were
visages that provoked and enthralled;  shop windows, people
in a hurry down on fifth avenue or in perfect repose in central park
, Charlie Mingus outside the village vanguard
or Paul Simon on a evening stroll and townhouses and
skyscrapers.  what can a poor boy do if he can't join a rock
and roll band?  photograph, of course. But the more serious stuff -  decent cameras, a few
workshops, acquiring photo books of winogrand and cartier-
bresson, long hours at moma and the getty, dabbling in wet
darkrooms - all that happened in the last 15 years or so, in
Fresno.  Most often used a 35mm rangefinder and less often
a slr with a long lens  and till 2011, it was analog film.   The
'breakdown' happened last year,  it's a digital rangefinder
for me now, This is a different road, but exciting nevertheless.
THEME:
The original title I had in mind was ' you are quite alone'.
too absolute, too emphatic, a little arrogant or pompous, I
thought. so you say, enough of this existential stuff.  Then you
 look around  you see it in magazine covers and
self-help book titles:  How to lose 20 pounds in 30  days,
how to become a millionaire before you turn 35, and in
spam e-mails: how to enlarge certain parts of your anatomy.
hence the new title, so now you know.
